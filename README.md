21-game

---

the silly 2-player counting game we all played as kids, built in [Factor](https://github.com/factor/factor)

an extensible API so you can write new game-modes and algorithms without writing much new code and duplicating the base game.

to demonstrate the extensibility, load the 21-game.clever vocabulary after 21-game, and then run 21-game's MAIN.
